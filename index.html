<div id = "tmp-about">ABOUT THE DATA</div>
<div class = "tmp-p">Data represent low-income jobs, defined here as jobs with earnings below $40,000 per year, and do not include all jobs, such as independent contractors and those working in the gig economy. This feature does not attempt to estimate jobs with pay cuts, only job loss.</div>

<div class = "tmp-p">These initial estimates are based on <a href = "https://esd.wa.gov/labormarketinfo/unemployment-insurance-data" target = "_blank">unemployment claims from Washington state</a>, which publishes weekly unemployment numbers by industry. To estimate the number of jobs lost by neighborhood nationwide, we apply the Washington state data on job loss by industry at all income levels to local Census tract-level data detailing the number of low-income jobs by industry. </div>

<div class = "tmp-p">We will update our estimates every week with new Washington state data, and then every month with national unemployment numbers from the <a href = "http://www.bls.gov/ces/" target = "_blank">US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> after the May 8 data release. </div>

<div class = "tmp-p">These are estimates and may not be comparable to actual job loss in each neighborhood. We highly recommend these results be interpreted as relative levels of job loss for the purposes of informing investments into neighborhoods to alleviate some of the economic burden. </div>


<div class = "tmp-p">For more information, please see our technical appendix.</div>
